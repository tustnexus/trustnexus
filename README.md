## 👋 Hi there, I'm Anil Bahuman!

I explore the crossroads of literature, learning, and technology — often by building thoughtful tools and resources that others can use, remix, and expand.

### 📚 My Current Project
I'm curating a public dataset of **original, rights-respecting summaries** for middle-grade fiction:
[**Grades6th7th8th-FictionReadingList**](https://github.com/yourusername/Grades6th7th8th-FictionReadingList)

- Helps educators and students discover diverse stories
- Respects publisher rights (no scanned or copied text)
- Includes YAML/JSON metadata to enable search, tagging, and educational use

Contributions are welcome! Check out the `CONTRIBUTING.md` if you'd like to help.
